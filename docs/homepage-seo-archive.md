## Hero Intro (Removed)

AKRIN is a Tokyo-based managed service provider delivering comprehensive IT management for businesses and organizations across Japan. Our four core services - ITAD, IT Asset Management, Managed IT Services, and IT Project Management - give organizations a single, bilingual partner for every stage of the IT lifecycle. From secure data destruction and asset tracking to 24/7 operational support and complex transformation projects, we combine in-depth local knowledge with global standards to help clients reduce costs, maintain compliance, and focus on their core business.

## Why Managed Services (Removed Section)

Tokyo is one of the world's most competitive and technology-driven business environments but organizations here face persistent challenges that make outsourcing IT management essential. 85% of Tokyo employers struggle to fill skilled IT roles, creating a talent shortage that makes building and maintaining in-house teams increasingly difficult and expensive. At the same time, companies must comply with strict regulatory requirements including Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and GDPR for international operations, while rapid technological change demands constant investment in equipment, software, and training.

Many organizations operating in Japan also require bilingual support in both Japanese and English to serve diverse teams and international clients. Without a partner who understands both languages and the local business environment, communication gaps can slow down incident resolution, delay projects, and create compliance risks.

Managed services in Tokyo address these challenges by providing access to skilled, bilingual professionals who combine in-depth local knowledge with global best practices. Rather than absorbing the complexity and expense of maintaining in-house resources, businesses gain comprehensive IT management through a subscription-based pricing model that converts capital expenditures (CapEx) into predictable operating expenses (OpEx) with reported operational cost reductions of up to 30%. This approach frees internal resources for strategic initiatives while ensuring that IT systems, security, and compliance are handled by experienced professionals who understand the unique demands of the Japanese market.

By outsourcing IT management to a dedicated service provider, companies gain immediate access to specialists with expertise across multiple technology domains from network security and cloud infrastructure to asset management and data destruction. Building equivalent capabilities in-house would require hiring multiple full-time professionals in a market where qualified talent is exceptionally scarce. A managed service provider also delivers business continuity benefits through standardized processes, documented procedures, and backup personnel ensuring operations continue smoothly even when individual team members are unavailable.

### ITAD Services - Secure IT Asset Disposition in Tokyo

IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) is the secure, compliant, and environmentally responsible process of retiring end-of-life IT equipment. As businesses in Japan regularly refresh their technology infrastructure, ITAD ensures that sensitive data is permanently destroyed and that retired assets are handled in accordance with both environmental laws and information security regulations.

AKRIN's ITAD services encompass the full disposition lifecycle. Our verified data destruction uses NIST 800-88 compliant software-based erasure methods, an approach many companies choose because it allows for reuse of equipment while providing verifiable proof of sanitization. Safe and secure data erasure is absolutely necessary to gain customer trust, and every device we process receives a Certificate of Data Destruction for your compliance records.

Our processes align with ISO 27001 (information security), ISO 14001 (environmental management), and ISO 9001 (quality management) standards. We provide detailed chain-of-custody tracking from pickup through final disposition, with audit-ready reporting that assists clients in meeting complex regulatory requirements. For organizations that require data destruction on their premises, we offer on-site data destruction services using portable certified equipment ensuring sensitive information never leaves your facility.

Retired assets that retain value are refurbished and remarketed through our asset recovery program, returning revenue to your organization. Equipment that cannot be reused is dismantled and recycled through eco-friendly disposal channels, keeping e-waste out of landfills and supporting circular economy principles. We also provide secure transportation with GPS-tracked logistics from your location to our certified processing facility.

ITAD compliance is particularly important for multinational companies operating across multiple countries with overlapping regulatory frameworks. Our ITAD services are designed to satisfy requirements across jurisdictions including Japan's APPI, the EU's GDPR, and US data protection standards, providing a unified approach to IT asset disposition that simplifies compliance for international clients based in Tokyo.

### IT Asset Management - Complete Lifecycle Visibility

Effective IT asset management gives organizations the ability to track and optimize every piece of equipment and software from procurement through retirement. AKRIN's solutions provide complete lifecycle visibility helping Tokyo businesses maintain accurate inventories, control costs, and make data-driven decisions about their technology investments.

Our IT asset management services include hardware and software inventory tracking, license compliance management, procurement advisory and vendor coordination, lifecycle planning and refresh scheduling, and detailed reporting that connects asset data to financial and operational outcomes. By maintaining a clear view of your asset estate, you avoid unnecessary spending on redundant equipment, prevent compliance gaps with software licenses, and plan technology refreshes proactively rather than reactively.

For clients with complex environments spanning multiple office locations across Japan or the Asia-Pacific region, our asset management platform provides a centralized dashboard that consolidates data across sites giving your management team the insights they need to align IT investments with business objectives. Asset management is especially valuable for organizations operating under audit requirements, where the ability to produce accurate, up-to-date records is essential for both internal governance and external regulatory compliance. Our solutions also support procurement optimization by identifying underutilized assets that can be redeployed rather than replaced, reducing waste and delivering cost savings across your technology portfolio.

### Managed IT Services - 24/7 Operational Support

AKRIN's managed IT services deliver round-the-clock operational support and proactive IT management designed to keep your teams productive and your systems stable. As a comprehensive IT management partner, we handle everything from day-to-day helpdesk requests to complex server infrastructure management, allowing your internal teams to focus on the work that drives your business forward.

On-site support: Our bilingual engineers provide hands-on support directly at your location in Tokyo and across Japan. From server and desktop troubleshooting to system integration, hardware upgrades, and network infrastructure management, our on-site team ensures your IT environment operates at peak performance. Services include proactive monitoring and maintenance, equipment installation and configuration, and round-the-clock assistance for critical issues.

Remote support services: For issues that do not require physical presence, our remote support team delivers rapid response through secure remote access tools. Remote services cover troubleshooting, software updates, patch management, performance optimization, and user assistance providing convenience and efficiency for distributed teams.

Service desk operations: Our managed service desk serves as the single point of contact for all IT support requests. We operate tiered support levels from basic user assistance through advanced server and network administration, with documented SLA response times, ticket tracking, and regular reporting on support metrics.

Network security and compliance: Comprehensive protection against evolving cyber threats is built into every managed services engagement. Our security solutions include firewall management, endpoint protection, vulnerability assessments, and compliance monitoring for GDPR, APPI, and other relevant legal requirements helping organizations maintain a strong security posture across their entire IT infrastructure.

Cloud infrastructure management: As businesses increasingly migrate workloads to cloud platforms, our managed services extend to cloud environments including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. We handle provisioning, monitoring, cost optimization, and security configuration so your cloud investment delivers maximum value.

Choosing the right managed service provider is a critical decision that affects your organization's operational efficiency, security posture, and long-term growth. AKRIN's proactive approach, continuous monitoring, preventative maintenance, and responsive technical support rather than reactive break-fix, is what sets exceptional customer service apart from basic IT outsourcing. Our clients benefit from enterprise-grade tools, advanced monitoring platforms, and automated security systems that would be prohibitively expensive for individual organizations to acquire independently.

### IT Project Management - Strategic Advisory and Delivery

For complex IT transformation initiatives, AKRIN provides strategic advisory and delivery management that guides projects from planning through execution. Our IT project management services help organizations navigate cloud migrations, infrastructure upgrades, office relocations, security implementations, and enterprise system deployments with controlled risk and continuity.

Our project managers bring deep technical expertise combined with an understanding of the Japanese business environment, ensuring smooth collaboration between local teams, international stakeholders, and technology partners. Services include project scoping, budgeting, and timeline management, vendor selection and coordination, risk assessment and mitigation strategies, change management and stakeholder communication, and post-implementation handoff to ongoing managed services.

Our methodology emphasizes transparent progress tracking and disciplined scope management. Clients receive regular status reports, budget tracking, and risk assessments throughout the project lifecycle delivering structured, predictable outcomes that align with your business goals. When the project completes, our team manages the transition to ongoing managed services ensuring that the solutions we build are fully supported from day one of production operations. This end-to-end approach eliminates the gaps that often occur when project delivery and operational support are handled by different providers, giving you a seamless experience from initial consultation through long-term management.

### Kitting Services for IT Equipment in Tokyo

Beyond our four core service areas, AKRIN provides kitting services that streamline the deployment of new IT equipment for businesses and agencies across Tokyo and Japan. Our kitting operations include hardware configuration, software imaging, asset tagging, peripheral bundling, and quality assurance testing, all performed at our facility before equipment ships to your site.

Our kitting process follows a structured workflow: we receive and inventory incoming equipment, configure each device according to your organization's standard build including operating system installation, domain joining, security agent deployment, and application setup then bundle peripherals such as monitors, keyboards, docking stations, and cables for each user. Every kitted system undergoes testing to verify hardware function, software load, and network connectivity before shipping.

Kitting services reduce on-site deployment time, ensure consistency across large rollouts, and free your internal IT team from repetitive setup tasks. For organizations managing office relocations, technology refreshes, or new employee onboarding at scale, our kitting and staging services ensure every device arrives ready to use from day one.

### How Managed Services Drive Operational Efficiency

Partnering with AKRIN for managed services in Tokyo delivers measurable improvements in operational efficiency that directly impact your bottom line. Our clients consistently report reduced operational costs through predictable subscription-based pricing, improved team productivity from proactive monitoring and rapid issue resolution, enhanced customer experience through reliable and always-available IT systems, and greater focus on strategic business initiatives rather than day-to-day IT troubleshooting.

When you outsource IT management to a managed service provider, you convert unpredictable technology spending into a fixed monthly investment. Our scalable solutions grow with your business, you never overpay for capacity you don't need, and you never fall short when demand increases. This financial predictability is especially valuable for organizations managing budgets across multiple business units or preparing for audit cycles where IT cost transparency is required.

AKRIN also leverages technology innovation to deliver greater value. Our managed services use AI-powered monitoring for predictive maintenance, automated patch management and software deployment, intelligent service desk tools that accelerate resolution times, and data analytics platforms that provide actionable insights into IT performance and spending. These tools enable our team to deliver more proactive support, faster response times, and deeper visibility into your IT environment than traditional managed service models.
